<h1>The best movies according to Mohan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bahubali</h3>
<p>Amazing Visuals. VFX is too good. Prabhas acting is another level.</p>
<h3>Vikram</h3>
<p>Screen presence of Kamal Hassan, Vijay Sethupathi, Fahadh Fassil is too good. Surya cameo as Rolex stole the show in the climax</p>
<h3>Sitaramam</h3>
<p>Good Love story movie</p>
